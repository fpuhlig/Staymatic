# Staymatic - Smart Accommodation Platform

## Core Idea

Create a modern accommodation platform where users can log their previous stays and reviews in their profile. The system analyzes this data and provides personalized suggestions based on it â€“ whether users are looking for similar experiences or want to try something completely new.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js with React and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB
- **Package Management:** Yarn workspaces for monorepo structure
- **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose

## Possible Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** The platform analyzes past stays and reviews to generate tailored accommodation suggestions or travel destinations.
- **Preference Analysis:** Identify which aspects (e.g., location, amenities, ambiance) are particularly appreciated or avoided based on user feedback.
- **Trip Planning Suggestions:** Combine accommodation recommendations with suggestions for activities, restaurants, and local experiences.
- **Smart Search Filters:** Enable filters based on preference criteria, such as "relaxing," "adventurous," or "cultural."
- **Chat Support:** Implement a support system that advises users in planning, answers questions about accommodations, and provides additional tips.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Optimize price suggestions in real-time based on demand, season, and individual user preferences.
