# Staymatic - AI-Enhanced Airbnb Clone

## Core Idea

Create an Airbnb clone where users can log their previous stays and reviews in their profile. An AI analyzes this data and provides personalized suggestions based on it â€“ whether users are looking for similar experiences or want to try something completely new.

## Possible Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** The AI analyzes past stays and reviews to generate tailored accommodation suggestions or travel destinations.
- **Mood and Preference Analysis:** Use machine learning to identify which aspects (e.g., location, amenities, ambiance) are particularly appreciated or avoided based on user feedback.
- **Automatic Trip Planning Suggestions:** Combine accommodation recommendations with suggestions for activities, restaurants, and local experiences.
- **Intelligent Search Filters:** Enable filters based on AI criteria, such as "relaxing," "adventurous," or "cultural."
- **Chatbot Assistance:** Implement a chatbot that advises users in planning, answers questions about accommodations, and provides additional tips.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Use AI to optimize price suggestions in real-time based on demand, season, and individual user preferences.
