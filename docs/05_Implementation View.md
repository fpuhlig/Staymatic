# Implementation View

## Project Requirements Compliance

### Build Automation

- **Expected:** gulp-based build system
- **Implemented:** Next.js built-in build system with Docker
- **Commands:**
  - `yarn install` - Install dependencies
  - `yarn build` - Build production application
  - `yarn dev` - Start development server
  - `docker-compose up` - Start full application stack

### Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn install` in the root directory (installs all workspace dependencies)
3. Set up environment variables (.env files)
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start the application
5. Access frontend at http://localhost:3000
6. Access backend API at http://localhost:8000

### Documentation Standards

- **Backend:** JSDoc comments for API endpoints and functions
- **Frontend:** TSDoc comments for React components and hooks
- **API:** OpenAPI/Swagger specification in YAML format

## Basic Architecture Decisions

- **Deployment Model:** Cloud hosting with container orchestration
- **Cost Model:** Combination of free and paid services based on scale

## What products and components should the system be built with?

### Frontend

- **Framework:** Next.js (React-based)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Development Tools:**
  - TypeScript
  - ESLint for code quality
  - Testing Frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library

### Backend

- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database ORM:** Mongoose
- **API:** RESTful architecture
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest

### Database

- **Primary Database:** MongoDB
- **Database Container:** Docker-based

### Recommendation System

- **Provider:** OpenRouter API
- **Integration:** REST API calls for personalization features

### Infrastructure

- **Package Manager:** Yarn workspaces
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Container Orchestration:** Docker Compose
- **Version Control:** Git
- **CI/CD Tools:** GitHub Actions (planned)
- **Monitoring Tools:** Sentry (planned)

### Development Tools

- **Code Quality:**

  - ESLint with TypeScript and Airbnb configuration
  - Prettier with Tailwind CSS plugin
  - Husky for Git hooks (pre-commit checks)
  - lint-staged for staged file linting

- **Authentication & Validation:**

  - better-auth for modern authentication
  - Zod for TypeScript schema validation

- **API Documentation:**

  - swagger-jsdoc for OpenAPI specification generation
  - swagger-ui-express for interactive API documentation

- **Development Automation:**
  - concurrently for running multiple development servers
  - nodemon for backend auto-restart
  - tsc-alias for TypeScript path mapping

## How will the system be developed and deployed?

### Development Process

1. **Local Development:**

   - Docker-based development environment
   - Hot-reloading for frontend and backend
   - Local MongoDB instance

2. **Version Control:**

   - Git for source code management
   - Feature branch workflow
   - Pull request reviews

3. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Automated tests (Jest, Cypress, Supertest)
   - Code quality checks (ESLint)
   - Automated deployment (GitHub Actions)

### Deployment Strategy

- **Staging Environment:** For testing and QA
- **Production Environment:** Cloud-hosted containers
- **Database:** Container-based with persistent storage

## What verification methods will be used?

### Testing

- See TestPlan.md for detailed testing strategy and frameworks

### Quality Assurance

- **Code Quality:** ESLint
- **Security:** Regular security audits
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

## How will the solution be operated?

### Hosting

- Cloud-hosted solution using containerized deployment

### Monitoring

- **Application Monitoring:** Error tracking (Sentry)
- **Performance Monitoring:** Response times (Prometheus, Grafana)
- **User Analytics:** Usage patterns

### Maintenance

- Regular security updates
- Database backups
- Performance optimization
