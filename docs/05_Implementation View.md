# Implementation View

## TODO: Basic Architecture Decisions
- **Deployment Model:** Local deployment vs. Cloud hosting
- **Cost Model:** Free vs. paid services

## What products and components should the system be built with?

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js (React-based)
- **UI Library:** shadcn/ui
- **Development Tools:**
  - TypeScript
  - ESLint for code quality
  - Testing Frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress

### Backend
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **API:** RESTful architecture
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest, Supertest

### Database
- **Primary Database:** MongoDB
- **Database Container:** Docker-based

### AI Integration
- **Provider:** OpenAI/ChatGPT API
- **Integration:** REST API calls

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Container Orchestration:** Docker Compose
- **Version Control:** Git
- **CI/CD Tools:** GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring Tools:** Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana

## How will the system be developed and deployed?

### Development Process
1. **Local Development:**
   - Docker-based development environment
   - Hot-reloading for frontend and backend
   - Local MongoDB instance

2. **Version Control:**
   - Git for source code management
   - Feature branch workflow
   - Pull request reviews

3. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Automated tests (Jest, Cypress, Supertest)
   - Code quality checks (ESLint)
   - Automated deployment (GitHub Actions)

### Deployment Strategy
- **Staging Environment:** For testing and QA
- **Production Environment:** TODO: Dependent on architecture decision
- **Database:** Container-based

## What verification methods will be used?

### Testing
- See TestPlan.md for detailed testing strategy and frameworks

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Quality:** ESLint
- **Security:** Regular security audits
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

## How will the solution be operated?

### Hosting
- TODO: Only local with Docker or actually hosted?

### Monitoring
- **Application Monitoring:** Error tracking (Sentry)
- **Performance Monitoring:** Response times (Prometheus, Grafana)
- **User Analytics:** Usage patterns

### Maintenance
- Regular security updates
- Database backups
- Performance optimization
