- **HTTPS for all connections:** Ensures secure communication between clients and servers.
- **Database Encryption:** Protects sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Secure Storage of Secrets (.env, Vault):** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive credentials and API keys.
- **Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:** Controls access to system resources and ensures only authorized users can perform specific actions (e.g., user login, role-based access control).
- **Input Validation:** Protects against various injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).

## Important Security Procedures

Here are the most important procedures to secure the system:

- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing:** Simulate attacks to find weaknesses in the system's defenses.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities.
- **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation at all entry points to prevent malicious data from entering the system.
- **Authentication/Authorization Tests:** Rigorously test authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure they are functioning correctly and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Regular Security Updates:** Apply timely security patches and updates to all system components (OS, libraries, frameworks).
- **Database Backups:** Implement regular, secure backups to prevent data loss in case of a security incident.
