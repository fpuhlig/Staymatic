# Security View

## Security Architecture Components

### Authentication Layer

- **JWT Token-based authentication** for API access
- **Session management** with secure token storage
- **Multi-factor authentication** support for sensitive operations
- **OAuth integration** for social login options

### Authorization Layer

- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with defined user roles
- **Resource-level permissions** for property and booking access
- **API endpoint protection** with middleware validation
- **Admin privilege separation** for platform management

### Data Protection Layer

- **HTTPS for all connections:** Ensures secure communication between clients and servers
- **Database encryption:** Protects sensitive data stored in the database at rest
- **Secure storage of secrets (.env, Vault):** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive credentials and API keys
- **Input sanitization and validation:** Protects against various injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)
- **Personal data anonymization** for analytics and reporting

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container security** with minimal base images and security scanning
- **Network segmentation** between frontend, backend, and database layers
- **API rate limiting** to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- **Regular security updates** for all system dependencies
- **Backup encryption** for data recovery scenarios

### Monitoring and Incident Response

- **Security event logging** for audit trails
- **Intrusion detection** and anomaly monitoring
- **Automated threat detection** for suspicious activities
- **Incident response procedures** for security breaches

## Security Threat Model

### High-Risk Threats

- **Data breaches** exposing user personal information
- **Payment fraud** and financial data compromise
- **Account takeover** through credential stuffing
- **Unauthorized property access** or booking manipulation

### Medium-Risk Threats

- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** attacks on user inputs
- **SQL injection** attempts on database queries
- **Distributed denial of service (DDoS)** attacks
- **Social engineering** attacks targeting support staff

### Mitigation Strategies

- Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
- Security awareness training for development team
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Third-party security audits for compliance verification

## Important Security Procedures

Here are the most important procedures to secure the system:

- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities
- **Penetration Testing:** Simulate attacks to find weaknesses in the system's defenses
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation at all entry points to prevent malicious data from entering the system
- **Authentication/Authorization Tests:** Rigorously test authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure they are functioning correctly and prevent unauthorized access
- **Regular Security Updates:** Apply timely security patches and updates to all system components (OS, libraries, frameworks)
- **Database Backups:** Implement regular, secure backups to prevent data loss in case of a security incident
- **Security Incident Response:** Maintain documented procedures for handling security incidents
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Ensure ongoing GDPR and data protection compliance
